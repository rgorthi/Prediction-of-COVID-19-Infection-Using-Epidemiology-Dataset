# Prediction-of-COVID-19-Infection-Using-Epidemiology-Dataset
In this project we are predicting and forecasting the COVID-19 outbreak in World using a machine learning approach, the aim of the project is to provide data analysis of covid-19 (a pandemic started in December 2019) using different kind of ML models such as SVM, polynomial regression and Prophet. Using those three models we predicting conform, death and recover cases for the World and we take one country which is India. Through plotting of data, various cases have been studied like most affected countries due to this pandemic as well as most affected state in India. In this paper we are using Time series dataset provided by Johns Hopkins University. The model is predicting the number of confirmed, recover and death cases based on data available from 22nd January, 2020 till up to today. In this project, the predictions on various cases have been done and finally, the accuracy of the algorithm has been determined. Comparison graphs has also been plotted to analyses how much World and INDIA is getting affected/recover day by day.
